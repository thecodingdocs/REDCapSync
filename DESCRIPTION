Description: Wraps dozens of REDCap API endpoints into a standardized R6
    object.  Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) is a survey and
    database web application software maintained by Vanderbilt University.
    It has a robust application programming Interface (API) utilized by
    several R packages.  'REDCapSync' uses 'redcapAPI' and 'REDCapR'
    behind-the-scenes to retrieve all metadata, data, and log details for
    a project. To minimize unneccesary server calls, the interim REDCap
    log is used to retrieve only recently updated records. The user can
    define subsets, derived fields, and transformations that save to a
    user-defined directory. Having a standarized, API-effecient,
    project-agnostic R object streamlines downstream use in scripts,
    functions, and shiny applications.
