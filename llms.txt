## REDCapSync [![](reference/figures/logo.png)](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync/)

Several R packages exist for using the REDCap Application Program
Interface (API) such as,
[REDCapR](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/ "REDCapR R package"),
[redcapAPI](https://github.com/vubiostat/redcapAPI/ "redcapAPI R package"),
and
[tidyREDCap](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/ "redcapAPI R package").
However, there is no “get-everything-from-REDCap” R package that can
produce a standardized
[R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html "R6 R package") object for any
REDCap project.
[REDCapSync](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync) streamlines
comprehensive extraction. When a sync is performed
[REDCapSync](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync) uses the
REDCap log to only update data that has changed since the last API call.
The final project-agnostic object facilitates further pipelining for
deidenification, deriving additional variables, linked excel sheets, and
exploratory data analysis with
[RosyREDCap](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/RosyREDCap/ "RosyREDCap").

## What is `{REDCapSync}`?

Using a cache of previous saves, a file directory, and the REDCap log,
{REDCapSync} updates only the data that has been changed since the last
API call. Each project becomes a standardized
[R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html "R6 R package") object that can be
used for the best that R has to offer via statistics, visualization,
shiny apps, and more! REDCapSync unleashes the full power of the REDCap
API even for the basic R user.

The aims of [REDCapSync](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync)
are to…

1.  Encapsulate the REDCap API into one R6 object to streamline use.
2.  Automate common tasks such as cleaning, deidentification and merges.
3.  Automate distrubution of user-defined Excel datasets to local/cloud
    storage for one or many REDCap projects.
4.  Convert ***uncoded*** REDCap data from R or Excel for upload using
    REDCap API.
5.  Power the companion shiny app
    [RosyREDCap](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/RosyREDCap/ "RosyREDCap R package")

By leveraging the combined strengths of R and REDCap, users can maintain
strong data pipelines that include statistics, visuals, and even shiny
applications!

## Installation

The stable release can be found on CRAN (PENDING SUBMISSION) and
installed with:

``` r
#install.packages("REDCapSync") #PLACEHOLDER NOT SUBMITTED TO CRAN YET
```

### Devopment Version

You can install the development version of REDCapSync from GitHub by
using the `pak` package.

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("thecodingdocs/REDCapSync")
# or try remotes install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("thecodingdocs/REDCapSync")
```

Windows users may need to install [RTools version
4.5](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/rtools.html "R Getting Started")
to use pak. If you have any issues, try downloading the most recent
version of R at RStudio and update all packages in RStudio. See
[thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started](https://www.thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started "R Getting Started").

### Getting Started!

Getting started is as simple as 1.) setting your tokens, 2.) setting up
a project, and 3.) running project\$sync(). See [Getting
Started](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/articles/REDCapSync.html "Getting Started")
page for the basics!

## Minimum Requirements

- R (and RStudio) installed on your computer or server.
- Access to at least one REDCap project (real or test) with API Token
  privileges according to user rights.
- Ideally, you should have User Permissions to logging in order to use
  the package effeciently
- Appropriate permission to export and analyze data for projects for
  which you have a token.
- Basic R knowledge such as installing a package and running code.
- Thoughtful attention to how and where data you create is used and
  stored.

## Disclaimers

- With great power comes great responsibility! The REDCap API has the
  with ability to read and write sensitive data. The API token holder is
  ultimately responsible for their activity and security.
- Always confirm that you have the appropriate permission to use and
  store data.
- REDCap is maintained by Vanderbilt University and is not responsible
  for testing, developing, or maintaining this software.
- This package is still in development and is subject to changes,
  especially pre-CRAN submission.

## Core Pipeline Functions (Basic)

For basic users use these core functions to maintain REDCap data
pipelines. Setup or Load your project. Update from REDCap using what is
already saved. Save the outputs to a directory.
