## REDCapSync [![](reference/figures/logo.png)](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync/)

Several R packages exist for using the REDCap Application Program
Interface (API) such as,
[REDCapR](https://ouhscbbmc.github.io/REDCapR/ "REDCapR R package"),
[redcapAPI](https://github.com/vubiostat/redcapAPI/ "redcapAPI R package"),
and
[tidyREDCap](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/ "redcapAPI R package").
However, there is no “get-everything-from-REDCap” R package that can
produce a standardized R object for any REDCap project.
[REDCapSync](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync) streamlines
comprehensive extraction with two key functions:
[`setup_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
and
[`sync_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/sync_project.md).
When a sync is performed
[REDCapSync](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync) uses the
REDCap log to only update data that has changed since the last API call.
The final project-agnostic object facilitates further pipelining for
deidenification, deriving additional variables, linked excel sheets, and
exploratory data analysis with
[RosyREDCap](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/RosyREDCap/ "RosyREDCap").

## What is `{REDCapSync}`?

Using a cache of previous saves, a file directory, and the REDCap log,
{REDCapSync} updates only the data that has been changed since the last
API call. Each project becomes a standardized nested R list object that
can be used for the best that R has to offer via statistics,
visualization, shiny apps, and more! REDCapSync unleashes the full power
of the REDCap API even for the basic R user.

The aims of [REDCapSync](https://github.com/thecodingdocs/REDCapSync)
are to…

1.  Wrap the REDCap API functionality “behind-the-scenes” to streamline
    its use.
2.  Maintain local/cloud versions of one or many REDCap projects by only
    updating recently changed records on a user-defined schedule, such
    as daily, weekly, or monthly.
3.  Automate tasks such as cleaning, deidentification and standard
    transformations.
4.  Allow bulk exports AND imports of ***uncoded*** REDCap data using R
    and Excel.
5.  Power the companion shiny app
    [RosyREDCap](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/RosyREDCap/ "RosyREDCap R package")

By leveraging the combined strengths of R and REDCap, users can maintain
strong data pipelines that include statistics, visuals, and even shiny
applications!

## Installation

The stable release can be found on CRAN (PENDING SUBMISSION) and
installed with:

``` r
#install.packages("REDCapSync") #PLACEHOLDER NOT SUBMITTED TO CRAN YET
```

### Devopment Version

You can install the development version of REDCapSync from GitHub by
using the `pak` package.

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("thecodingdocs/REDCapSync")
```

If you have any issues, try downloading the most recent version of R at
RStudio and update all packages in RStudio. See
[thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started](https://www.thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started "R Getting Started").

### Getting Started!

Getting started is as simple as 1.) setting your tokens, 2.) setting up
a project, and 3.) running sync. See [Getting
Started](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/articles/REDCapSync.html "Getting Started")
page for the basics!

## Minimum Requirements

- R (and RStudio) installed on your computer or server.
- Access to at least one REDCap project (real or test) with API Token
  privileges according to user rights.
- Ideally, you should have User Permissions to logging in order to use
  the package effeciently
- Appropriate permission to export and analyze data for projects for
  which you have a token.
- Basic R knowledge such as installing a package and running code.
- Thoughtful attention to how and where data you create is used and
  stored.

## Disclaimers

- With great power comes great responsibility! The REDCap API has the
  with ability to read and write sensitive data. The API token holder is
  ultimately responsible for their activity and security.
- Always confirm that you have the appropriate permission to use and
  store data.
- REDCap is maintained by Vanderbilt University and is not responsible
  for testing, developing, or maintaining this software.
- This package is still in development and is subject to changes,
  especially pre-CRAN submission.

# Package index

## Core Pipeline Functions (Basic)

For basic users use these core functions to maintain REDCap data
pipelines. Setup or Load your project. Update from REDCap using what is
already saved. Save the outputs to a directory.

- [`get_projects()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/get_projects.md)
  : Get your REDCap projects used by REDCapSync
- [`setup_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
  [`load_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
  [`load_test_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
  : Setup or Load REDCapSync Project
- [`sync_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/sync_project.md)
  : Synchronize REDCap Data

## Everything by Topic (Intermediate/Advanced)

Expands on functionality and breaksdown core feautures into more
customizable parts

### Project Cache

REDCapSync cahces user-level project metadata (name, directory, links,
last update and other details). Tokens and data are NOT stored here.

- [`get_projects()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/get_projects.md)
  : Get your REDCap projects used by REDCapSync
- [`cache_clear()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/cache_clear.md)
  : Clear your cached projects
- [`cache_path()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/cache_path.md)
  : Get your Get Cache Path
- [`cache_remove_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/cache_remove_project.md)
  : Remove project from cache
- [`project`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/project.md)
  : Setup or Load REDCapSync Project

### Tokens

Tokens are required to use the REDCap API. Never share your tokens.

- [`view_project_token()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/view_project_token.md)
  : View the REDCap API Token Stored in the Session
- [`test_project_token()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/test_project_token.md)
  : Test REDCap API Token linked to a project Object

### Setup/Load/Save/Delete project Object

project objects are R lists meant to store all metadata and data for a
single REDCap project. They utilize the REDCap log to only fetch recent
updates. The can be “mirrored” to a local/cloud directory to maintain
file pipelines and/or used for an exploratory data analysis shiny app
via `RosyREDCap::run_RosyREDCap`.

- [`setup_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
  [`load_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
  [`load_test_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/setup-load.md)
  : Setup or Load REDCapSync Project
- [`save_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/save-deleteproject.md)
  : Save or Delete project file from the directory

### Sync Function

sync_project uses project object in the environment.

- [`sync_project()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/sync_project.md)
  : Synchronize REDCap Data
- [`sync_all()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/sync_all.md)
  : Synchronize REDCap Data

### Project Summaries

One of the core internal motivations for REDCapSync development was to
have REDCap-project-agnositic functions that perform key transformations
such as deidentify, derive fields, and transform (merge). However, these
functions might not be utilized by the average user.

- [`add_project_summary()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/add_project_summary.md)
  **\[experimental\]** : Add a Subset to a REDCap Database
- [`generate_project_summary()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/generate_project_summary.md)
  **\[experimental\]** : Generate a Summary from a Subset Name
- [`clear_project_summaries()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/clear_project_summaries.md)
  **\[experimental\]** : clear_project_summaries

### Download from, Upload to, and Delete from REDCap

Always use with caution! Package takes several steps to test and confirm
uploads but ultimately the user is responsible for data changes.
Remember REDCap always keeps a log of changes.

- [`raw_to_labelled_form()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/raw_to_labelled_form.md)
  : Raw to Labelled REDCap forms
- [`labelled_to_raw_form()`](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/reference/labelled_to_raw_form.md)
  : Clean to Raw REDCap forms
