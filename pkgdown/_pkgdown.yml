reference:
  - title: Core Pipeline Functions (Basic)
    desc: For basic users use these core functions to maintain REDCap data pipelines. Setup or Load your project. Update from REDCap using what is already saved. Save the outputs to a directory.
    contents:
      - sync
      - get_projects
      - setup_project
      - sync_project
  - title: Everything by Topic (Intermediate/Advanced)
    desc: Expands on functionality and breaksdown core feautures into more customizable parts
  - subtitle: Project Cache
    desc: REDCapSync cahces user-level project metadata (name, directory, links, last update and other details). Tokens and data are NOT stored here.
    contents:
      - get_projects
      - cache_clear
      - cache_path
      - check_folder_for_projects
      - project_health_check
  - subtitle: Tokens
    desc: Tokens are required to use the REDCap API. Never share your tokens.
    contents:
      - set_project_token
      - view_project_token
      - test_project_token
  - subtitle: Setup/Load/Save/Delete project Object
    desc: project objects are R lists meant to store all metadata and data for a single REDCap project. They utilize the REDCap log to only fetch recent updates. The can be "mirrored" to a local/cloud directory to maintain file pipelines and/or used for an exploratory data analysis shiny app via `RosyREDCap::run_RosyREDCap`.
    contents:
      - setup_project
      - load_project
      - delete_project
      - save_project
  - subtitle: Sync Functions
    desc: Run Syncs on periodic bases; sync is "hands-free", while sync_project uses project object in the environment.
    contents:
      - sync
      - sync_project
  - subtitle: project setup Object Modifications
    desc: One of the core internal motivations for REDCapSync development was to have REDCap-project-agnositic functions that perform key transformations such as deidentify, derive fields, and transform (merge). However, these functions might not be utilized by the average user.
    contents:
      - default_project_transformation
      - add_default_project_fields
      - add_default_project_transformation
      - add_default_project_summary
      - add_project_field
      - add_project_transformation
      - add_project_summary
  - subtitle: project Object Outputs
    desc: Mirror your project object to a local/cloud file system. If you have summaries, will only update file if record belonging to that summary was updated.
    contents:
      - generate_project_summary
  - subtitle: Data Helpers
    desc: Used for managing to-be-upload data
    contents:
      - find_upload_diff
      - raw_to_labelled_form
      - labelled_to_raw_form
      - read_from_REDCap_upload
  - subtitle: Download from, Upload to, and Delete from REDCap
    desc: Always use with caution! Package takes several steps to test and confirm uploads but ultimately the user is responsible for data changes. Remember REDCap always keeps a log of changes.

      - upload_project_to_REDCap
      - upload_form_to_REDCap
