  - title: Core Pipeline Functions (Basic)
    desc: For basic users use these core functions to maintain REDCap data pipelines. Setup or Load your project. Update from REDCap using what is already saved. Save the outputs to a directory.
    contents:
      - sync
      - get_projects
      - setup_project
      - sync_project
      - drop_REDCap_to_directory
      - summarize_project

  - title: Everything by Topic (Intermediate/Advanced)
    desc: Expands on functionality and breaksdown core feautures into more customizable parts
  - subtitle: Project Cache
    desc: REDCapSync cahces user-level project metadata (name, directory, links, last update and other details). Tokens and data are NOT stored here.
    contents:
      - get_projects
      - cache_clear
      - cache_path
      - check_folder_for_projects
      - project_health_check
  - subtitle: Tokens
    desc: Tokens are required to use the REDCap API. Never share your tokens.
    contents:
      - set_REDCap_token
      - view_REDCap_token
      - test_REDCap_token
  - subtitle: Setup/Load/Save/Delete project Object
    desc: project objects are R lists meant to store all metadata and data for a single REDCap project. They utilize the REDCap log to only fetch recent updates. The can be "mirrored" to a local/cloud directory to maintain file pipelines and/or used for an exploratory data analysis shiny app via `RosyREDCap::run_RosyREDCap`.
    contents:
      - setup_project
      - load_project
      - load_project_from_path
      - delete_project
      - save_project
  - subtitle: Get from REDCap
    desc: For most project, even with tens-of-thousands records and hundreds of variables, this can be handeled with sync_project. This package is not presently intended for massive REDCap projects.
    contents:
      - get_REDCap_report
  - subtitle: Data Helpers
    desc: Used for managing to-be-upload data
    contents:
      - add_ID_to_DF
      - find_upload_diff
      - raw_to_labelled_form
      - labelled_to_raw_form
      - read_from_REDCap_upload
  - subtitle: Upload to and Delete from REDCap
    desc: Always use with caution! Package takes several steps to test and confirm uploads but ultimately the user is responsible for data changes. Remember REDCap always keeps a log of changes.
    contents:
      - add_REDCap_folder
      - upload_project_to_REDCap
      - upload_file_to_REDCap
      - upload_file_to_REDCap_file_repository
      - upload_form_to_REDCap
      - upload_transform_to_project
      - delete_REDCap_file
      - delete_REDCap_records
      - delete_file_from_REDCap
  - subtitle: project Object Modifications
    desc: One of the core internal motivations for REDCapSync development was to have REDCap-project-agnositic functions that perform key transformations such as deidentify, derive fields, and transform (merge). However, these functions might not be utilized by the average user.
    contents:
      - clean_project
      - deidentify_project
      - filter_project
      - default_project_transformation
      - add_default_project_transformation
      - add_default_project_fields
      - add_project_subset
      - add_project_field
      - transform_project
      - untransform_project
  - subtitle: project Object Outputs
    desc: Mirror your project object to a local/cloud file system. If you have subsets, will only update file if record beloning to that subset was updated.
    contents:
      - drop_REDCap_to_directory
      - generate_horizontal_transform
      - generate_summary_from_subset_name
      - summarize_project
  - subtitle: Sync Functions
    desc: Run Syncs on periodic bases; sync and sync_projects are "hands-free" and they depend on sync_project which can work by name with the project object in the environment.
    contents:
      - sync
      - sync_projects
      - sync_project

  - subtitle: Experimental/Dev Functions
    desc: These functions are still in development and is subject to changes.
