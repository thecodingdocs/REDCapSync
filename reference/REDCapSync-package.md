# REDCapSync: Synchronize Data Pipelines from the REDCap API

Uses the REDCap API to build a standardized R list object that can be
stored in a user-defined local or cloud directory. Checks the REDCap log
and only gets necessary data updates. Full updates are only triggered by
major metadata changes. User can define subsets, derived fields, and
transformations, which are stored in the list object and passed down to
output objects to be used downstream for data pipelines and the R shiny
app RosyREDCap.
