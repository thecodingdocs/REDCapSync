The REDCapSync package benefits from storing/caching key information about your different projects. The two most important pieces of information stored in the cache are the `short_name` identifying your project and your `directory` where your project data.frame is stored. Only metadata, no tokens or data files, are stored in the cache. This is enough information to be able to find where you have chosen to securely store your files, load what has already been collected, and then communicate with R to fetch any new updates. REDCapSync's ability to store your projects in a standardized directory is what allows for powerful pipeline tasks.

```{r, eval=F}
library(REDCapSync) # don't forget to load the package
```

# The Cache

Using the `hoadr` package, R finds the standard location where R typically stores cached package data. For example, on Mac the location might look like, "/Users/yourmacname/Library/Caches/R/REDCapSync". Your exact path can be found with `cache_path()` At the time writing this article, the only thing that REDCapSync stores in this cache is the projects data.frame, which can be loaded with `projects <- get_projects()`.

```{r, eval=F}
cache_path()
```

# Projects

After a project has been set up, a list object containing cached project data can be retrieved using the get_projects() function. To learn how to set up a project, see the [get started](https://thecodingdocs.github.io/REDCapSync/articles/REDCapSync.html) guide.

```{r, eval=F}
projects <- get_projects()
print.data.frame(projects)
```
