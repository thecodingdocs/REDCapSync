```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
library(REDCapSync)
```

The goal of REDCapSync is to encapsulate a REDCap project into a standardized object. R6 gives a way of keeping some elements internal to the object. Behind-the-scenes is an R list where all of the metadata and data is stored.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
listviewer::jsonedit(REDCapSync:::TEST_CLASSIC)
```

The R6 object contains those things behind-the-scenes but then uses several to build an environment. This allows `TEST$sync()` to update `TEST` without having to do `TEST <- TEST |> sync_something() |> another_function()`

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(REDCapSync)
TEST <- load_test_project(with_data = TRUE)
# Update From REDCap 

# Explore Whats Inside

# Generate Outputs

```
